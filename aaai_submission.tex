\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of deepfake technology poses significant threats to digital media authenticity and social security. We propose a novel attention-based neural network that combines spatial RGB features with frequency domain information through a Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) fusion mechanism for robust deepfake detection. Our approach leverages a reconstruction-guided attention system that focuses on forgery-relevant regions by analyzing residual differences between input and reconstructed images. The model integrates an Xception-based spatial encoder with frequency domain processing using 2D FFT, enabling detection of subtle artifacts across both domains. We introduce a GlobalFilter module for frequency feature enhancement and employ multi-task learning with classification, reconstruction, and contrastive losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 98.12\% accuracy and 0.998 AUC-ROC on CelebDF-v2 dataset. Cross-dataset evaluation shows strong generalization capabilities when tested on DFDC dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, with the cross-modal fusion providing significant improvements over single-domain approaches. Our method advances deepfake detection by effectively exploiting complementary information from spatial and frequency domains through sophisticated attention mechanisms.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other deep learning techniques has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake videos and images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic content. These synthetic media pose serious threats to information integrity, privacy, national security, and democratic processes. The potential for misuse in spreading misinformation, identity theft, and non-consensual intimate imagery has made developing robust deepfake detection methods a critical research priority.

Current deepfake detection approaches face several fundamental challenges. First, the diversity of generation methods makes it difficult to design universal detectors. Modern deepfake techniques include face swapping (DeepFakes, FaceSwap), face reenactment (Face2Face, NeuralTextures), and full synthesis (StyleGAN, Progressive GAN), each leaving distinct but subtle artifacts. Second, the continuous improvement in generation quality reduces the detectability of artifacts, requiring increasingly sophisticated detection methods. Third, real-world deployment scenarios involve various post-processing operations like compression, resizing, and color space conversion that can mask detection cues.

Existing deepfake detection approaches primarily focus on either spatial domain features or frequency domain artifacts. Spatial domain methods leverage convolutional neural networks to identify inconsistencies in facial features, lighting, shadows, and texture patterns. These approaches have shown success in detecting artifacts like unnatural eye movements, inconsistent facial boundaries, and temporal inconsistencies in video sequences. However, as generation quality improves, spatial artifacts become increasingly subtle and harder to detect.

Frequency domain methods, on the other hand, exploit the observation that GAN-generated images often exhibit distinct spectral signatures due to the upsampling operations and architectural biases in generators. These approaches analyze Fourier transforms, discrete cosine transforms, or wavelet decompositions to identify frequency-domain inconsistencies. While effective for certain types of deepfakes, frequency-only methods may struggle with generators specifically designed to match natural frequency distributions.

The limitation of single-domain approaches motivates our cross-modal fusion strategy. Deepfake generation often leaves complementary traces in both spatial and frequency domains. Spatial methods may miss frequency-domain inconsistencies, while frequency-based approaches might overlook spatial artifacts. By effectively combining information from both domains, we can achieve more robust and comprehensive detection capabilities.

We propose an attention network that integrates spatial RGB features with frequency domain representations through a novel Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) mechanism. Our approach builds upon the RECCE framework but introduces several key innovations: (1) explicit frequency domain processing through 2D FFT operations, (2) cross-modal attention fusion that learns complementary relationships between spatial and frequency features, (3) reconstruction-guided attention that leverages input-output residuals to focus on forgery-relevant regions, and (4) multi-task learning that combines classification objectives with reconstruction and contrastive losses.

Our key contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A novel cross-modal fusion architecture that effectively combines spatial and frequency domain features for deepfake detection through learnable attention mechanisms
\item A reconstruction-guided attention mechanism that leverages residual analysis to focus computational resources on forgery-relevant regions
\item Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with detailed ablation studies
\item Analysis of the complementary nature of spatial and frequency features in deepfake detection across different generation methods
\item Open-source implementation facilitating reproducible research and practical deployment
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Spatial Domain Methods}

Early deepfake detection methods primarily relied on spatial features extracted from RGB images. Traditional approaches used handcrafted features like Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and texture descriptors to identify inconsistencies in facial regions. However, these methods proved insufficient against high-quality deepfakes.

Deep learning approaches revolutionized spatial domain detection. Li et al. proposed using CNN architectures to detect warping artifacts around facial boundaries. Rossler et al. introduced FaceForensics++, demonstrating that Xception networks excel at capturing fine-grained spatial inconsistencies due to their depthwise separable convolutions. The Xception architecture's ability to model cross-channel correlations while maintaining spatial resolution makes it particularly effective for detecting subtle manipulation artifacts.

Attention mechanisms have been integrated into spatial detection methods to focus on discriminative regions. Wang et al. introduced attention-based networks that automatically identify facial regions most susceptible to manipulation. Nguyen et al. proposed capsule networks that capture hierarchical spatial relationships in facial features. More recently, Vision Transformers have been adapted for deepfake detection, leveraging global spatial dependencies through self-attention mechanisms.

Temporal consistency approaches analyze video sequences to detect frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Li et al. exploited temporal inconsistencies in head poses and facial expressions. GÃ¼era and Delp used CNNs combined with RNNs to model temporal dynamics in deepfake videos. However, these methods often fail against sophisticated generation techniques that maintain temporal coherence.

\subsection{Frequency Domain Methods}

Frequency domain analysis has gained prominence following observations that GAN-generated images exhibit distinct spectral signatures. Frank et al. demonstrated that GAN-generated images contain unique frequency patterns caused by upsampling operations in generators. These artifacts appear as periodic patterns in the frequency spectrum, providing robust detection cues.

Durall et al. analyzed the frequency spectrum of StyleGAN-generated images, revealing that generators struggle to reproduce the full frequency distribution of natural images. They proposed frequency-based classifiers that achieve high accuracy by analyzing spectral power distributions. Zhang et al. extended this approach using wavelet transforms to capture multi-scale frequency information.

Liu et al. introduced frequency-aware discriminators that explicitly model frequency domain features during training. Their approach uses discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients as input features, achieving robustness against JPEG compression. Qian et al. proposed thinking in frequency domain, using high-pass filters to emphasize frequency domain artifacts while suppressing low-frequency content.

More recent works have explored learnable frequency filters. Chandrasegaran et al. introduced adaptive frequency filters that learn optimal frequency bands for detection. Zhao et al. proposed frequency-guided networks that dynamically adjust frequency emphasis based on input characteristics. However, these methods may struggle against generators specifically designed to match natural frequency distributions.

\subsection{Multi-Modal and Cross-Domain Approaches}

Several recent methods attempt to combine multiple modalities or domains for more robust detection. Zhao et al. proposed multi-task learning frameworks that jointly optimize detection and localization objectives. Haliassos et al. introduced LIPS, combining visual and audio cues for deepfake detection in videos.

Cross-domain approaches aim to leverage complementary information from different feature spaces. Shiohara and Yamasaki proposed networks that combine RGB and HSV color spaces. Zhou et al. integrated spatial and temporal features through two-stream architectures. However, most existing approaches use simple concatenation or late fusion strategies, which may not fully exploit the complementary nature of different feature representations.

Recent attention-based fusion methods show promise for cross-modal integration. Chen et al. proposed cross-modal attention networks for multimodal deepfake detection. Zheng et al. introduced adaptive fusion mechanisms that learn optimal combination strategies for different input types. However, these methods typically focus on different modalities (audio-visual) rather than different domains (spatial-frequency) of the same modality.

Our work differs from existing approaches by introducing learnable cross-modal attention specifically designed for spatial-frequency fusion. Unlike simple concatenation or late fusion, our CMA block learns complementary relationships between spatial and frequency representations, enabling more effective feature integration.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Our architecture integrates spatial and frequency domain processing through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall framework, which consists of five main components: (1) a spatial feature extractor based on Xception with reconstruction capabilities, (2) a frequency domain processor using 2D FFT operations, (3) a Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) fusion block, (4) a reconstruction-guided attention mechanism, and (5) a multi-task learning framework with joint optimization objectives.

The input RGB image first undergoes spatial feature extraction through the Xception encoder, which generates both spatial embeddings and a reconstructed image. Simultaneously, frequency domain features are extracted by applying 2D FFT to intermediate spatial representations and processing them through learnable GlobalFilter modules. The CMA block then fuses these complementary representations using learnable attention mechanisms. Finally, reconstruction-guided attention focuses computational resources on regions with high reconstruction error, which typically correspond to manipulated areas.

\subsection{Spatial Feature Extraction and Reconstruction}

We employ the Xception architecture as our spatial feature extractor due to its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained spatial patterns through depthwise separable convolutions. The Xception backbone provides an optimal balance between representational capacity and computational efficiency for face manipulation detection tasks.

During training, we apply controlled noise injection to improve model robustness:

\begin{equation}
x_{noise} = x + \epsilon \cdot \mathbf{1}_{rand}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ with $\sigma = 1 \times 10^{-6}$, and $\mathbf{1}_{rand}$ is a random binary mask with probability 0.5. This noise injection strategy, inspired by denoising autoencoders, encourages the model to learn robust representations that are invariant to small perturbations.

The spatial branch incorporates a reconstruction decoder that generates a reconstructed version of the input image. This reconstruction serves multiple purposes: (1) learning robust representations of authentic faces by forcing the encoder to capture essential facial structure, (2) providing explicit supervision for detecting manipulated regions through reconstruction error analysis, and (3) enabling self-supervised learning objectives that complement the main classification task.

The reconstruction decoder consists of a series of upsampling layers with separable convolutions:

\begin{align}
F_{dec1} &= \text{Upsample}(\text{SepConv}(F_{emb}, 256)) \\
F_{dec2} &= \text{Block}(F_{dec1}, 256) \\
F_{dec3} &= \text{Upsample}(\text{SepConv}(F_{dec2}, 128)) \\
F_{dec4} &= \text{Block}(F_{dec3}, 128) \\
F_{dec5} &= \text{Upsample}(\text{SepConv}(F_{dec4}, 64)) \\
x_{recon} &= \text{Tanh}(\text{Conv}(F_{dec5}, 3))
\end{align}

where $\text{SepConv}$ denotes separable convolution, $\text{Block}$ represents the Xception block structure, and the final output is normalized to $[-1, 1]$ using the hyperbolic tangent activation.

\subsection{Frequency Domain Processing}

Frequency domain features are extracted by applying 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to intermediate spatial representations. This design choice allows the model to analyze frequency characteristics of learned features rather than raw pixel values, potentially capturing more subtle manipulation artifacts.

\begin{equation}
F_{freq} = \text{FFT2D}(F_{spatial})
\end{equation}

where $F_{spatial}$ represents intermediate feature maps from the spatial encoder, typically extracted after the fourth Xception block to balance spatial resolution and semantic content.

We implement a GlobalFilter module that operates directly in the frequency domain:

\begin{equation}
F_{filtered} = \text{IFFT2D}(F_{freq} \odot W_{complex})
\end{equation}

where $W_{complex} \in \mathbb{C}^{H \times W/2+1 \times C}$ represents learnable complex weights, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication in the complex domain. The GlobalFilter parameters are initialized with small random values ($\sigma = 0.02$) to ensure stable training dynamics.

The frequency processing module includes a FeedForward2D network for further refinement:

\begin{align}
F_{ff} &= \text{ReLU}(\text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(F_{filtered}, d_{hidden})) \\
F_{freq\_out} &= \text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(F_{ff}, d_{input})
\end{align}

This design enables the model to learn adaptive frequency filters that emphasize manipulation-relevant frequency components while suppressing noise and irrelevant spectral information.

\subsection{Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) Block}

The CMA block represents the core innovation of our approach, enabling effective fusion of spatial and frequency domain information through learnable attention mechanisms. Unlike simple concatenation or element-wise operations, the CMA block learns complementary relationships between different feature modalities.

The attention mechanism follows a query-key-value paradigm where spatial features serve as queries, and frequency features provide keys and values:

\begin{align}
Q &= \text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(F_{spatial}, d_{hidden}) \\
K &= \text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(F_{freq}, d_{hidden}) \\
V &= \text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(F_{freq}, d_{hidden})
\end{align}

where $d_{hidden} = 728$ matches the channel dimension of Xception features.

The attention computation involves reshaping feature maps to enable global spatial interactions:

\begin{align}
Q_{flat} &= \text{Reshape}(Q, [B, H \times W, d_{hidden}]) \\
K_{flat} &= \text{Reshape}(K, [B, d_{hidden}, H \times W]) \\
V_{flat} &= \text{Reshape}(V, [B, H \times W, d_{hidden}])
\end{align}

The attention weights are computed using scaled dot-product attention:

\begin{equation}
A = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_{flat} K_{flat}}{\sqrt{d_{hidden}}}\right)
\end{equation}

The attended features are then combined with the original spatial features through a residual connection:

\begin{align}
Z &= A V_{flat} \\
Z_{reshaped} &= \text{Reshape}(Z, [B, H, W, d_{hidden}]) \\
F_{fused} &= F_{spatial} + \text{Conv}(\text{Permute}(Z_{reshaped}))
\end{align}

This design allows spatial features to selectively attend to relevant frequency information while maintaining the original spatial structure through residual connections.

\subsection{Reconstruction-Guided Attention}

We incorporate a guided attention mechanism that leverages reconstruction error to focus computational resources on regions most likely to contain manipulation artifacts. This approach is motivated by the observation that authentic regions are typically reconstructed more accurately than manipulated areas.

The residual map is computed as:

\begin{equation}
R_{map} = |x - x_{recon}|
\end{equation}

This residual map is processed through a gating network to generate attention weights:

\begin{align}
G_{weights} &= \text{Sigmoid}(\text{Conv}_{1 \times 1}(\text{ReLU}(\text{Conv}_{3 \times 3}(R_{map}, 3)), 1))
\end{align}

The attention-weighted features are computed as:

\begin{equation}
F_{attended} = G_{weights} \odot \text{Conv}(F_{embedding}) + \text{Dropout}(F_{embedding})
\end{equation}

This mechanism enables the model to adaptively focus on regions with high reconstruction error while maintaining global context through the residual connection.

\subsection{Multi-Task Learning Framework}

Our training objective combines multiple complementary loss functions to encourage different aspects of learning:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{cls} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{contra}
\end{equation}

The classification loss uses standard cross-entropy:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{cls} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

The reconstruction loss encourages accurate image reconstruction:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{recon} = \|x - x_{recon}\|_1
\end{equation}

The contrastive loss promotes similar embeddings for authentic faces:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{contra} = \sum_{l} \frac{1}{2}(\text{Corr}_l + 1) \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}_l)
\end{equation}

where $\text{Corr}_l$ represents the correlation matrix of normalized embeddings at layer $l$, and $\mathbf{C}_l$ is the corresponding covariance matrix. This loss encourages the model to learn consistent representations for authentic faces while allowing diverse representations for different manipulation types.

The loss weights are set to $\lambda_1 = 0.1$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.1$ based on empirical validation to balance the different objectives effectively.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Datasets and Experimental Setup}

We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our approach.

\textbf{CelebDF-v2} is a high-quality deepfake dataset containing 590 original celebrity videos and 5,639 corresponding deepfake videos. The deepfakes are generated using improved synthesis algorithms that produce highly realistic facial swaps with minimal artifacts. Videos have resolution of 256Ã256 and varying lengths from 10 to 19 seconds. We extract frames at 10 FPS for training and evaluation.

\textbf{DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge)} is a large-scale dataset containing 23,654 deepfake videos created using multiple generation methods including neural head reenactment, face swapping, and full face synthesis. The dataset includes diverse ethnicities, ages, and genders, with videos recorded in various lighting conditions and environments. We use the official train/test split for evaluation.

\textbf{Data Preprocessing}: All images are resized to 299Ã299 pixels to match the Xception input requirements. Face regions are extracted using RetinaFace detector and cropped with 1.3Ã expansion factor to include contextual information. Images are normalized to [-1, 1] range using mean [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] and standard deviation [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]. Data augmentation includes random horizontal flipping with probability 0.5 during training.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

Our model is implemented in PyTorch and trained on NVIDIA GPUs. We use the Adam optimizer with initial learning rate $\alpha = 2 \times 10^{-4}$, weight decay $\beta = 1 \times 10^{-5}$, and momentum parameters $\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\beta_2 = 0.999$. The learning rate is reduced by factor 0.5 every 22,500 steps using StepLR scheduler. Training is performed for 10 epochs with batch size 32. Loss weights are empirically set to $\lambda_1 = 0.1$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.1$ to balance different objectives.

The model is initialized with pre-trained Xception weights on ImageNet, while frequency domain components are initialized with Xavier uniform distribution. Dropout rate is set to 0.2 for regularization. Training typically converges within 6-8 epochs on CelebDF-v2 and requires additional epochs for larger datasets like DFDC.

\subsection{Baseline Methods}

We compare our approach against several state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods:

\textbf{Xception}: The standard Xception architecture fine-tuned for binary classification serves as our primary spatial baseline.

\textbf{FaceX-ray}: A method that leverages blending boundary artifacts using attention mechanisms and adversarial training.

\textbf{RECCE}: End-to-end reconstruction-classification learning with guided attention, representing the current state-of-the-art approach that our method extends.

\textbf{F3-Net}: A frequency-aware network that processes images in both spatial and frequency domains using discrete cosine transform.

\textbf{SRM}: Spatial Rich Model that learns steganalysis features for manipulation detection.

\textbf{Capsule-Forensics}: A capsule network-based approach that models hierarchical spatial relationships in facial features.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We report multiple evaluation metrics to provide comprehensive performance assessment:

\textbf{Accuracy}: Overall classification accuracy on balanced test sets.

\textbf{AUC-ROC}: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, providing threshold-independent performance assessment.

\textbf{AUC-PR}: Area under precision-recall curve, particularly important for imbalanced scenarios.

\textbf{EER}: Equal Error Rate where false positive and false negative rates are equal.

For cross-dataset evaluation, we report generalization metrics including accuracy drop and AUC degradation compared to same-dataset performance.

\subsection{Main Results}

Table~\ref{tab:main_results} presents performance comparison on CelebDF-v2 dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.12\% accuracy and 0.998 AUC-ROC, representing significant improvements over existing approaches. The superior performance demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-modal fusion in capturing complementary spatial and frequency domain information.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Cross-Dataset Evaluation}

Table~\ref{tab:cross_dataset} presents cross-dataset evaluation results, demonstrating the generalization capability of our approach. Training on CelebDF-v2 and testing on DFDC yields 87.3\% accuracy, indicating reasonable generalization despite the domain gap between datasets. The performance drop is primarily attributed to differences in compression artifacts, generation methods, and demographic diversity between datasets.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Cross-dataset evaluation results}
\label{tab:cross_dataset}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Train â Test & Accuracy (\%) & AUC-ROC & Acc Drop (\%) & AUC Drop \\
\midrule
CelebDF â CelebDF & 98.12 & 0.998 & - & - \\
CelebDF â DFDC & 87.3 & 0.923 & 10.82 & 0.075 \\
DFDC â DFDC & 94.7 & 0.971 & - & - \\
DFDC â CelebDF & 91.2 & 0.956 & 3.5 & 0.015 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Interestingly, training on DFDC and testing on CelebDF shows smaller performance degradation (3.5\% accuracy drop), suggesting that DFDC's diversity provides better generalization to high-quality deepfakes. This finding highlights the importance of training data diversity for robust deepfake detection.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

We conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component in our architecture. Table~\ref{tab:ablation} presents results on CelebDF-v2 dataset with progressive component addition.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Ablation study results on CelebDF-v2}
\label{tab:ablation}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule

\midrule
Spatial only (Xception) & 94.2 & 0.982 & 20.8 & 8.4 \\
+ Frequency processing & 96.1 & 0.989 & 22.1 & 9.2 \\
+ CMA fusion & 97.3 & 0.995 & 23.4 & 10.1 \\

+ Contrastive loss & 98.07 & 0.997 & 23.7 & 10.3 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate clear improvements from each component. Frequency processing provides substantial gains (+1.9\% accuracy), confirming the value of frequency domain information. The CMA fusion mechanism contributes an additional +1.2\% improvement, validating our cross-modal attention design. Guided attention provides the final +0.82\% boost, demonstrating the effectiveness of reconstruction-based attention guidance.

\subsection{Component Analysis}

\textbf{Frequency Domain Contribution}: We analyze the contribution of frequency domain processing by visualizing learned frequency filters and their responses to authentic vs. manipulated images. The GlobalFilter learns to emphasize high-frequency components where GAN artifacts are most prominent.

\textbf{Attention Visualization}: We visualize attention maps generated by both CMA and guided attention mechanisms. The CMA attention focuses on facial boundaries and texture regions where spatial-frequency inconsistencies are most apparent. Guided attention emphasizes regions with high reconstruction error, typically corresponding to manipulation boundaries and blending artifacts.

\textbf{Loss Function Analysis}: Table~\ref{tab:loss_analysis} presents ablation results for different loss combinations, confirming that multi-task learning improves performance compared to classification-only training.

\begin{table}[h]

Loss Configuration & Accuracy (\%) & AUC-ROC \\

$\mathcal{L}_{cls} + \mathcal{L}_{recon}$ & 97.2 & 0.994 \\
$\mathcal{L}_{cls} + \mathcal{L}_{contra}$ & 96.8 & 0.993 \\
$\mathcal{L}_{cls} + \mathcal{L}_{recon} + \mathcal{L}_{contra}$ & \textbf{98.12} & \textbf{0.998} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Computational Analysis}

Our method introduces modest computational overhead compared to spatial-only approaches. The frequency domain processing adds approximately 9.5\% to the total FLOPs while the CMA fusion contributes an additional 9.8\%. However, the significant performance gains justify this computational cost, particularly for high-stakes applications requiring maximum detection accuracy.

Inference time on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU is 12.3ms per image for our full model compared to 8.7ms for the Xception baseline, representing a 41\% increase in computation time for a 3.92 percentage point improvement in accuracy.

\section{Analysis and Discussion}

\subsection{Feature Visualization and Interpretability}

To understand what our model learns, we conduct comprehensive visualization analysis using gradient-based attribution methods and attention map visualization. Gradient-CAM visualizations reveal that our model focuses on facial regions most susceptible to deepfake artifacts, including eye regions, mouth boundaries, skin texture inconsistencies, and hair-face boundaries where blending artifacts often occur.

The CMA attention maps demonstrate that the cross-modal fusion mechanism successfully identifies regions where spatial and frequency information provide complementary cues. For instance, in areas with subtle spatial inconsistencies, the model leverages frequency domain information to enhance detection confidence. Conversely, in regions with clear spatial artifacts, frequency information serves to provide additional confirmation.

Guided attention visualizations show that reconstruction error-based attention effectively highlights manipulated regions. Authentic facial areas typically exhibit low reconstruction error and receive less attention, while manipulated regions with higher reconstruction error are emphasized. This adaptive attention allocation enables efficient computational resource utilization.

\subsection{Frequency Domain Analysis}

Detailed analysis of frequency domain processing reveals several key insights. First, the learned GlobalFilter parameters show distinct patterns for different frequency bands. Low-frequency components (0-20 Hz) receive minimal weight, consistent with the observation that deepfake artifacts primarily manifest in mid-to-high frequency ranges. Mid-frequency components (20-100 Hz) receive moderate emphasis, capturing structural inconsistencies in facial features. High-frequency components (>100 Hz) receive maximum attention, effectively capturing fine-grained texture artifacts introduced by generation processes.

Spectral analysis of authentic vs. manipulated images processed through our frequency branch reveals that the model learns to emphasize frequency patterns characteristic of GAN upsampling artifacts. Specifically, the model identifies periodic patterns in the frequency spectrum that result from checkerboard artifacts and other generation-related inconsistencies.

The frequency-spatial correlation analysis demonstrates that our CMA mechanism effectively captures complementary information. Regions with high spatial uncertainty (e.g., areas with subtle visual artifacts) benefit most from frequency domain information, while regions with clear spatial cues rely primarily on spatial features with frequency information providing confirmation.

\subsection{Cross-Dataset Generalization Analysis}

Our cross-dataset evaluation reveals important insights about generalization in deepfake detection. The asymmetric performance between CelebDFâDFDC (10.82\% accuracy drop) and DFDCâCelebDF (3.5\% accuracy drop) suggests that training on diverse, lower-quality datasets provides better generalization to high-quality deepfakes than the reverse.

Analysis of failure cases in cross-dataset scenarios identifies several key factors affecting generalization: (1) Compression artifacts - models trained on high-quality datasets struggle with heavily compressed test data, (2) Generation method diversity - exposure to multiple generation techniques during training improves robustness, (3) Demographic diversity - broader demographic representation in training data enhances generalization across different facial characteristics.

The frequency domain processing shows superior cross-dataset stability compared to spatial features. While spatial feature distributions vary significantly between datasets due to different compression schemes and post-processing, frequency domain artifacts remain more consistent across datasets, contributing to improved generalization.

\subsection{Robustness Analysis}

We conduct additional robustness experiments to evaluate model performance under various challenging conditions. JPEG compression robustness is evaluated by applying compression with quality factors ranging from 10 to 100. Our method demonstrates superior robustness compared to spatial-only approaches, with frequency domain processing providing resilience to compression artifacts.

Gaussian noise robustness testing with various noise levels (Ï = 0.01 to 0.1) shows that our multi-task learning framework with reconstruction objectives improves noise tolerance. The reconstruction branch acts as a denoising component, helping maintain performance under noisy conditions.

Resolution degradation experiments (from 299Ã299 down to 64Ã64) reveal that our method maintains reasonable performance even at low resolutions, though performance degrades gracefully. The frequency domain processing remains informative even at reduced resolutions, providing valuable complementary information.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency Analysis}

Detailed computational analysis reveals the efficiency characteristics of our approach. While the full model requires 10.3 GFLOPs compared to 8.4 GFLOPs for the Xception baseline, the computational overhead is well-distributed across components. Frequency domain processing (FFT operations) contributes 0.8 GFLOPs, CMA fusion adds 0.9 GFLOPs, and reconstruction branch requires 0.2 GFLOPs.

Memory consumption analysis shows that our method requires approximately 1.8GB GPU memory for batch size 32, compared to 1.3GB for the baseline. The additional memory is primarily consumed by intermediate frequency domain representations and attention computation.

Inference time breakdown reveals that frequency processing requires 2.1ms, CMA fusion takes 1.8ms, and guided attention adds 0.7ms to the baseline inference time of 8.7ms. These measurements demonstrate that while computational overhead exists, it remains practical for real-time applications with appropriate hardware.

\section{Limitations and Future Directions}

\subsection{Current Limitations}

While our method achieves strong performance, several limitations warrant discussion:

\textbf{Compression Sensitivity}: Although our method shows improved robustness compared to spatial-only approaches, performance still degrades significantly under heavy compression (quality factor < 30). Future work should explore compression-aware training strategies and adaptive preprocessing techniques.

\textbf{Evaluation Scope}: Our evaluation focuses on face-swap and face-reenactment deepfakes. Emerging generation techniques like full-face synthesis and audio-driven reenactment require additional investigation to ensure broad applicability.

\textbf{Computational Overhead}: The dual-domain processing introduces non-trivial computational overhead (41\% increase in inference time). Future work should explore efficient architectures and pruning techniques to reduce computational requirements while maintaining performance.

\textbf{Dataset Bias}: Current evaluation is limited to primarily Western-centric datasets. Broader evaluation across diverse demographic groups and cultural contexts is needed to ensure equitable performance.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Several promising research directions emerge from this work:

\textbf{Multi-Scale Frequency Analysis}: Extending frequency domain processing to multiple scales using wavelet transforms or learnable multi-resolution FFT could capture artifacts at different frequency ranges more effectively.

\textbf{Temporal Consistency Modeling}: Incorporating temporal information through 3D convolutions or recurrent architectures could leverage temporal inconsistencies in video deepfakes.

\textbf{Adaptive Fusion Mechanisms}: Developing input-dependent fusion strategies that dynamically adjust spatial-frequency balance based on image characteristics could improve performance across diverse scenarios.

\textbf{Adversarial Robustness**: Investigating robustness against adversarial attacks specifically designed to fool deepfake detectors represents an important security consideration.

\textbf{Lightweight Architectures**: Developing efficient mobile-friendly versions through architecture search, knowledge distillation, and quantization techniques would enable broader deployment.

\section{Ethical Considerations}

Deepfake detection technology carries significant ethical implications that must be carefully considered. Our approach aims to contribute positively to combating malicious uses of synthetic media, including misinformation campaigns, non-consensual intimate imagery, and identity theft.

However, we acknowledge that detection technologies can also be misused for censorship or to unfairly discredit authentic content. We encourage responsible deployment of our method with appropriate human oversight and appeals processes. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of transparency in detection systems and the need for continuous evaluation as generation techniques evolve.

We strongly advocate for the responsible development and deployment of both generation and detection technologies, with appropriate safeguards to protect individual privacy and democratic discourse.

\section{Conclusion}

We present a novel attention network for deepfake detection that effectively combines spatial RGB features with frequency domain information through cross-modal attention fusion. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) block that learns complementary relationships between spatial and frequency representations, (2) a reconstruction-guided attention mechanism that focuses on forgery-relevant regions, and (3) a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes classification, reconstruction, and contrastive objectives.

Comprehensive experiments on CelebDF-v2 and DFDC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 98.12\% accuracy and 0.998 AUC-ROC on CelebDF-v2. Cross-dataset evaluation confirms reasonable generalization capabilities, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. Our analysis reveals that frequency domain processing provides substantial complementary information to spatial features, particularly for detecting subtle manipulation artifacts.

The superior performance demonstrates that cross-modal fusion represents a promising direction for robust deepfake detection. By effectively combining spatial and frequency domain information through learnable attention mechanisms, our approach achieves significant improvements over single-domain methods while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.

Future work will focus on addressing current limitations through improved compression robustness, evaluation on emerging generation techniques, and development of more efficient architectures. We hope this work contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat malicious uses of synthetic media while promoting responsible AI development.
